## 🧠 Project Workflow

### 1. Data Loading and Modeling
- **Uploaded multiple CSV files** into Power BI.
- **Built a star schema** by creating relationships between tables:
  - Connected **Employee** table with **Education Level**, **Performance Rating**, **Rating Level**, and **Satisfying Level** tables.
- Ensured **one-to-many** relationships for cleaner model integrity.
- Created a **Date Table** to enable time-based analysis.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Investigated general **hiring trends** over time.
- Analyzed **department-wise** and **job role-wise** distributions.
- Explored **performance ratings** across different employee groups.

### 3. Advanced Demographic and Performance Analysis
- Analyzed **age**, **gender**, **ethnicity**, and **marital status** impacts on performance.
- Built a **Performance Tracker** dashboard with custom measures.
- Investigated detailed satisfaction factors.

### 4. Attrition Analysis and Insights
- Identified major factors affecting **employee attrition**.
- Created **Attrition Scorecards** showing trends by department, role, and demographics.
- Provided actionable recommendations to reduce attrition.

### 5. Report Design and User Experience
- Applied a **consistent color theme** aligned with Atlas Labs branding.
- Improved **page navigation** for a smoother user experience.
- Used **buttons**, **tooltips**, and **slicers** for interactivity.
- Cleaned up layouts for a **professional and minimalistic** look.
